  <h2> About Me: </h2>
  <p>
    I am currently studying information systems at a university in the midwestern
    United States. My previous education and experience surounded the topic of
    academic ecological research. I am still very interested in ecological research
    but a longing to develop my data analytics, software development, and database management
    skills pushed me to return to school.

    In my exploration of new data management techniques, I have tackled several
    independent and occupational projects. Each project has helped me to understand
    new ways to interact with data and often times a new programming language.
    I have enjoyed each of the projects and am excited to take on more, challenging
    projects in the near future.
